## Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets


In this project, we will build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. We will have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. Eventually, the LSTM model that we will build will help to solve the problem by classifying the tweets in test dataset into disastrous content or not.
